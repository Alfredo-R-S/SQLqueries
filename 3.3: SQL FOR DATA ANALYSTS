3.3: SQL FOR DATA ANALYSTS

Write a SELECT command to find out what film genres exist in the category table. 
SELECT  category_id, name FROM category

Write an INSERT statement to add the following genres to the 
category table: Thriller, Crime, Mystery, Romance, and War: 
INSERT INTO category (category_id, name)  
VALUES ('17', 'Thiller') ('18', 'Crime'), ('19', 'Mystery'), ('20', 'Romance'), ('21', 'War')


The genre for the movie African Egg needs to be updated to thriller. Work through the steps below to 
make this change:
Write the SELECT statement to find the film_id for the movie African Egg. 
SELECT film_id, title 
FROM film 
where title = 'African Egg'


Once you have the film_ID and category_ID, write an UPDATE command to change the category in the 
film_category table (not the category table). Copy-paste this command into your answers document. 
UPDATE film_category  
SET category_id = 17  
WHERE film_id = 5

Since there arenâ€™t many movies in the mystery category, you and your manager decide to remove it from 
the category table. Write a DELETE command to do so and copy-paste it into your answers document. 
DELETE FROM  category  
WHERE  name  =  'Mystery'
