3.6: SUMMARIZING & CLEANING DATA IN SQL

Find out if the film table and the customer table contain any dirty data, specifically non-uniform or 
duplicate data, or missing values. 

DUPLICATE DATA 

FILM TABLE 
QUERY: 
SELECT title, release_year, language_id, rental_duration, 
COUNT(*) 
FROM film 
GROUP BY title, release_year, language_id, rental_duration 
HAVING COUNT(*) >1

CUSTOMER TABLE 
QUERY: 
SELECT DISTINCT customer_id, store_id 
FROM customer 
GROUP BY customer_id, store_id 
HAVING COUNT(*) >1

NON-UNIFORM DATA 

FILM TABLE 
QUERY: 
SELECT rating, 
COUNT(*) 
FROM film 
GROUP BY rating
As the rating table has a user-defined data type, it makes sense to check here for non-uniform 
data.

CUSTOMER TABLE 
QUERY: 
SELECT first_name, last_name,  
COUNT(*) FROM customer  
GROUP BY first_name, last_name

Summarize your data 
Use SQL to calculate descriptive statistics for both the film table and the customer table. For 
numerical columns, this means finding the minimum, maximum, and average values. For non
numerical columns, calculate the mode value. 

DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS 
FILM TABLE 
NUMERICAL COLUMNS 
QUERY: 
SELECT  
COUNT(*) AS total_movies, 
ROUND(AVG(rental_duration),2) AS average_rental_duration, 
MIN(rental_duration) AS min_rental_duration, 
MAX(rental_duration) AS max_rental_duration, 
ROUND(AVG(rental_rate),2) AS average_rental_rate, 
MIN(rental_rate) AS min_rental_rate, 
MAX(rental_rate) AS max_rental_rate, 
ROUND(AVG(length),2) AS average_length, 
MIN(length) AS min_length, 
MAX(length) AS max_length, 
ROUND(AVG(replacement_cost),2) AS average_replacement_cost, 
MIN(replacement_cost) AS min_replacement_cost, 
MAX(replacement_cost) AS max_replacement_cost 
FROM film

NON-NUMERICAL COLUMNS 
QUERY: 
SELECT

MODE() WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY description) AS modal_description, 
MODE() WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY rating) AS modal_rating, 
MODE() WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY special_features) AS modal_special_features

CUSTOMER TABLE 
NUMERICAL COLUMNS 
QUERY:

NON-NUMERICAL COLUMNS 
QUERY: 
SELECT

MODE() WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY last_name) AS modal_last_name, 
MODE() WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY email) AS modal_email
