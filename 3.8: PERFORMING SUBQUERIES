3.8: PERFORMING SUBQUERIES 

Copy the query you wrote in step 3 of the task from Exercise 3.7: Joining Tables of Data into the 
Query Tool. This will be your subquery, so give it an alias, “total_amount_paid,” and add 
parentheses around it. 
SELECT ROUND(AVG(total_amount_paid),2) AS avg_top_5_customers 
FROM ( 
      SELECT A.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name, c.city, d.country, SUM(amount) AS total_amount_paid

Find out how many of the top 5 customers you identified in step 1 are based within each country. 
Your final output should include 3 columns: 
• “country” 
• “all_customer_count” with the total number of customers in each country 
• “top_customer_count” showing how many of the top 5 customers live in each country
