3.4: DATABASE QUERYING IN SQL 

You need to get some data from the “film” table and decide to use the query SELECT * FROM 
film. 
You realize that only the “film_id” and “title” columns are needed. Write a new query that selects 
only those 2 columns. 
SELECT film_id, title  
FROM film

Ordering the Data: 
In the pgAdmin Query Tool, run a query that selects every film from the “film” table, with the 
movies sorted by title from A to Z, then by most recent release year, and then by highest to 
lowest rental rate. 
• SELECT title 
FROM film 
ORDER BY film ASC 
• SELECT title, release_year 
FROM film 
ORDER BY release_year DESC 
• SELECT title, rental_rate 
FROM film 
ORDER BY rental_rate DESC

Grouping Data:  
The strategy department has asked you the questions below. Write a SQL query to retrieve the 
correct answers, then extract your results as a CSV file. 
What is the average rental rate for each rating category? 
SELECT rating, AVG (rental_rate) 
FROM film 
GROUP BY rating 

What are the minimum and maximum rental durations for each rating category? 
SELECT rating, MIN (rental_duration), MAX (rental_duration) 
FROM film 
GROUP BY rating
