3.7: JOINING TABLES OF DATA

Write a query to find the top 10 countries for Rockbuster in terms of customer numbers. (Tip: 
you’ll have to use GROUP BY and ORDER BY, both of which follow the join.)

TOP 10 COUNTRIES 
SELECT D.country, 
COUNT(A.customer_id) AS total_customers_per_country 
FROM customer A 
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id 
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id 
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_ID = D.country_ID 
GROUP BY country 
ORDER BY total_customers_per_country DESC 
LIMIT 10

Next, write a query to identify the top 10 cities that fall within the top 10 countries you identified 
in step 1. (Hint: the top 10 cities can be in any of the countries identified—you don’t need to 
create a separate list for each country.)

TOP 10 CITIES  
QUERY; 
SELECT C.city, D.country, COUNT (customer_id) AS count_of_customers 
FROM customer A 
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id 
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id 
INNER JOIN country D on C.country_id = D.country_id 
WHERE D.country IN 
(SELECT D.country 
FROM customer A 
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id 
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id 
INNER JOIN country D on C.country_id = D.country_id 
GROUP BY country 
ORDER BY COUNT (customer_id) DESC 
LIMIT 10) 
GROUP BY D.country, C.city

Now write a query to find the top 5 customers from the top 10 cities who’ve paid the highest total 
amounts to Rockbuster. The customer team would like to reward them for their loyalty! 

TOP 10 CUSTOMERS
SELECT A.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name, c.city, d.country, SUM(amount) AS 
total_amount_paid 
FROM customer A 
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id 
INNER JOIN city C ON b.city_id = c.city_id 
INNER JOIN country D ON c.country_id = d.country_id 
INNER JOIN payment E ON A.customer_id = E.customer_id 
WHERE c.city IN 
    (SELECT C.city 
    FROM customer A 
    INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id 
    INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id 
    INNER JOIN country D on C.country_id = D.country_id 
    WHERE D.country IN 
        (SELECT D.country 
        FROM customer A 
        INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id 
        INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id 
        INNER JOIN country D on C.country_id = D.country_id 
        GROUP BY country 
        ORDER BY COUNT (customer_id) DESC 
        LIMIT 10) 
    GROUP BY D.country, C.city 
    ORDER BY COUNT (customer_id) DESC 
    LIMIT 10) 
GROUP BY A.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name, d.country, c.city 
ORDER BY total_amount_paid DESC 
LIMIT 5
